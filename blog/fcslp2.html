          <b>Day Eight - Sunday</b>
          <br>
          Today we visited Blechley Park, where the Enigma (as well as other notable cyphers) was cracked during WWII, as well as the Museum of Computing. The two visits complimented each other nicely, as the Museum of Computing contained modern reconstructions of the original machines - the Bombe, and Colossus - which were originally built in Blechley Park! Lunch was provided by one of the on-site cafes at Blechley Park, where we actually got to order from a menu! After the visit to the Museum of Computing, we boarded a coach bound back to Bristol, to return to our original accomodation.

          <b>Day Nine - Monday</b>
          <br>
          Back to the classrooms today, this time focusing on Web Apps. After lunch at the university, and more classroom sessions, our evening activity was ready. Tonight, we would be flying (and racing) drones! Each of the four groups had half an hour each to decide between them who would pilot the drones in the final time trial race - for which two of my teammates volunteered, and ended up winning best two times overall!
          <br><br>

          <b>Day Ten - Tuesday</b>
          <br>
          More classroom sessions, focusing on Security Operations Centres (to prepare us for the visits tomorrow). Lunch was at the university's hall again. The evening activity for us tonight was a masterclass about business dilemmas, and ethical challenges such as the infamous trolley problem.
          <br><br>

          <b>Day Eleven - Wednesday</b>
          <br>
          Today was spent away from the university. We took a coach down to London (which meant an early start), in order to visit BT's security centre, the Google offices, and a "surprise" trip down the Thames river via speedboat (the secret wasn't very well kept), which was absolutely amazing. BT demonstrated some really interesting monitoring software, Google had an incredibly well-decorated building (and nap pods!), and the speedboat tour was fantastic. After a whole pizza each at International House (courtesy of QA), we then took the coach back to UWE. Given that we were returning to London in two days' time, this didn't make much sense to any of us!
          <br><br>

          <b>Day Twelve - Thursday</b>
          <br>
          Having returned back to UWE, we had more classroom sessions today. The focus was about malware, including getting to play with Wannacry, the ransomware that hugely affected Britain's NHS a few years ago. Instead of having more time to prepare for our group presentations, which are due to be presented tomorrow, we were visited by not only representatives from Lockheed Martin, but also a police officer from the regional cyber crime unit. After they made their presentations, we were presented a buffet for dinner, including sandwiches, chicken strips and bottles of various soft drinks. After this, there was not a great deal of time to make further preparations for our presentations, and most people went to bed early.
          <br><br>

          <b>Day Thirteen - Friday</b>
          <br>
          Early start again today - back to London we go; all of us dreading our group presentations looming above us. Some worked frantically on the three-hour coach ride into London to finalise their parts of their respective presentations, and other people caught up on some sleep they had lost out on due to the early start! Overall, the team presentations went smoothly however, and the panel of professionals seemed both pleased and impressed by our works. After more sandwiches at QA's training centre, we had an audio tour around the Houses of Parliament, where British laws are discussed and debated before potentially being implemented. We'd be spending the night at Imperial College London again, as we are flying the next day to the United States!
          <br><br>

          <b>Day Fourteen - Saturday</b>
          <br>
          After dragging ourselves out of bed at the crack of dawn, we finalised our packing and brought our suitcases down to the lobby to catch a coach to Heathrow Airport, for our 7-hour transatlantic flight to Washington D.C. The plane ride was smooth and after what did not feel like 7 hours, we were touching down in Washington D.C. to begin the American section of our programme. This was in the evening (local time) however, so we were briefed about the U.S. section of the trip, including itineraries and $140 in cash each, straight from the U.S. government, for food. We were then taken to a local "British-inspired" pub, which did not come across as a "British" pub to us Britons! We then returned to the hotel we were staying in to unpack and rest for the first full day tomorrow.
