          <b>The First Day - Sunday</b>
          <br>
          After arriving early at UWE to begin the Exchange, I found I was the only person yet to arrive. Shortly afterwards, the other 9 British participants arrived, shortly followed by 8 American participants. The flight for the other two American participants was delayed by over 6 hours so they wouldn't be arriving until the next morning. After a short safeguarding brief, we were given free time at our accomodation to unpack and unwind. We opted to play the Jackbox party games at a picnic table outside. Shortly after this we were called for dinner at the cafeteria nearby, after which we played some card games before a debrief and some more free time (and more Jackbox) before lights out at 10:30pm.
          <br><br>
          <b>Day Two - Monday</b>
          <br>
          Today after breakfast at 8am we had our first classroom session of the programme. This was an introduction to the internet, and the UK's and US's respective Cyber Security strategies. After a short presentation it was time for lunch. This was a packed lunch from the cafe. The afternoon held a visit to GCHQ in store for most of the participants - a quarter were unfortunately barred from attending due to their nationalities being outside of the Five Eyes intelligence agreement. An alternative activity was arranged for the 5 participants that couldn't attend. We were given a talk about CyberFirst, and shown around the datacenter before a careers talk from some employees. In the evening there were no activities planned so we played card games and yet more Jackbox.
          <br><br>
          <b>Day Three - Tuesday</b>
          <br>
          More classroom sessions today - this time about networking. Lunch today was also a packed lunch. After baking in the hot classroom for a few more hours, we had dinner at the cafeteria. The evening held an "SDI Masterclass", a session where we would assess ourselves against a few questions in order to assess whether we were people-focused, planning-focused or action-focused people. Somehow, I turned out to be a people-focused person! We were then told that this would decide our groups for a team presentation activity to be presented at the end of next week. This was met by a collective groan, before our teams were announced, and we were given time to work on starting our presentations. We all went to bed shortly after, dreading the team presentations.
          <br><br>
          <b>Day Four - Wednesday</b>
          <br>
          Today held a day away from the university. After breakfast, we travelled to EE's local datacentre where we were shown around the physical datacentres, as well as being given a presentation about the security of mobile networks and how 5g is being tested and prepared for public deployment! After this, we had a packed lunch, and travelled to EE's Service Management and Security Operations centres, where we were given tours and demonstrations, including EE's Cyber Security team. After travelling back to the university and having some downtime, we were taken into Bristol for a social activity - an escape room! We divided ourselves into four teams for the 4 rooms that had been set up identically, this <i>was</i> a competition after all! Thanks to my teammates, we managed to be the first of the teams to finish, with eleven minutes left out of the allocated hour. The other teams finished not long after either, and the challenge was very entertaining. When we arrived back at the accomodation for the evening, we were instructed to go straight to bed.
          <br><br>
          <b>Day Five - Thursday</b>
          <br>
          Another day within the university today, following the same format as Tuesday, a couple days prior. This time, the classroom sessions were about the cloud, and included labs on using cloud providers such as GCP and AWS. I already had experience with this, so it was great to help my peers instead. We had another masterclass in the evening, this time about challenging unconscious bias and the way we think. After this, we had to pack for our weekend away from the university - some people more successfully than others. It would also be an early start the next day, so we couldn't spend too long dawdling either.
          <br><br>
          <b>Day Six - Friday</b>
          <br>
          Trip to London today! After a 6am alarm, we would be spending nearly 3 hours on a coach into the centre of London, to visit the US Embassy, and QA's centre; they are the providers for the UK part of this programme after all! The embassy is a very impressive building, and this time we were allowed into its heart to have a look around some of the less important areas within, and have a panel with some of the government's top Cyber Security employees, as well as the US Ambassador - to talk about their pasts, their thoughts on the topic at the moment, as well as their ideas about the future. We were not given very long to ask questions, but then we had lunch, provided by the embassy. After this, the ambassador invited us all to visit his office, which was very impressive! The view from his balcony was absolutely stunning. We were then taken to QA's centre for a handful of talks from QA employees training people in Cyber Security, as well as a treasure hunt around the area, including sights such as the London Bridge. After this, we took the Underground to Imperial College where we would be spending the night.
          <br><br>
          <b>Day Seven - Saturday</b>
          <br>
          Not such an early start today, as today we would be spending the day in London again. This time, we spent the morning in the London Science Museum, which had a special exhibit from GCHQ on, focusing on WWII as well as the history of cryptography. We then walked to St James' Park, where we had lunch (provided by Pret-A-Manger), before walking to a bus stop nearby for a bus tour in the afternoon. This took us to see all the main tourist attractions in the centre of London, as well as a few smaller (but equally important) buildings such as the Bank of England. We then had a coach journey to Cranfield University, near Milton Keynes. The dinner here was amazing!
