          <b>Day Fifteen - Sunday</b>
          <br>
          After a later start than we were used to (a lie-in, finally!), we were greeted by freshly-made waffles for breakfast! This made a stark change from the toast and croissants we were used to from UWE at this point, and being so excited about the food, the U.S. section of the programme looked to be impressing already. Today, we were given the choice (individually) between visiting a handful of museums, or walking around Washington D.C. and seeing the sights. I personally opted for the walk, and visited many monuments and memorials, such as the Lincoln Memorial, Capitol Building, and the White House (to name a few!). This involved getting lunch from food vans mid-trip, but after the waffles for breakfast, I didn't want any more food yet. At 6pm, and having spent all day outside, returning to the air-conditioned hotel was a welcome experience, before we walked to the local Italian restaurant for dinner. After this, there was an optional trip to see the live US Navy Memorial for those of us still awake enough to go. Only around 6 of us went to see this, but it was absolutely incredible, and getting the opportunity to listen to the live music was a great memory! After this, we returned to the hotel to sleep.

          <b>Day Sixteen - Monday</b>
          <br>
          A little earlier awake today, but after a comfortable night in the double beds of the hotel, this wasn't an issue. More waffles for breakfast, but today held some important visits, so today required formal clothing. This was important because today's visits were a couple of panels at the U.S. Department of State, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, where we talked to government officials involved with cyber security. With lunch at IHOP in-between, which was our first experience of truly "American" food. However, as lunch was so substantial, very few of us ate much for dinner, which was at the Grilled Cheese DC restaurant, specialising in (you guessed it) grilled cheeses. As we would be flying again tomorrow, most of us used the opportunity of the evening to pack our belongings, before going to bed.

          <b>Day Seventeen - Tuesday</b>
          <br>
          Yet again, waffles for breakfast (I'm hardly complaining). Formal wear again, as today we would visit Northrop Grumman, who make the content for the U.S. based CyberPatriot programme, and the U.K. equivalent, Cyber Centurion, which I participated in last year. The inside of the site was incredible, and their demonstrations of various equipment and technology, that they use in Defense, were astounding. This included a frequency generator that could suspend small polystyrene balls in mid-air, as if there were a forcefield! We were given free reign to choose our own lunches (in groups) today, and we ended up visiting a very tasty Mediterranean restaurant. This preceded our 5-hour flight to LAX, which also went smoothly. After landing, and arriving at the university accomodation we'd be staying in for the next few days, we were surprised to find rooms where the beds were not made, and the sheets did not include duvets, but instead, rather grimy and scratchy blankets. This was solved, however, by using a sheet instead. Our instructors promised that they'd source extra sheets for us, which thankfully, they did. This came as a surprise to us after only being able to enter our rooms at 11pm, all eager to sleep as we had been awake for many hours (our brains thought it was 4am).
          <br><br>

          <b>Day Eighteen - Wednesday</b>
          <br>
          Not a great lie-in today, as breakfast was scheduled for 8am. This meant we had to get up early, compromising the amount of sleep available to us. However, there was no time to worry about this, as promptly after breakfast we were taken for our first visit in California, to the Orange County Regional Computer Forensics Laboratory (OCRCFL for short). This was a super interesting visit, and we got to see tools that are designed to guess and bruteforce mobile device passwords, as well as boxes that would open certain phones within minutes. The FBI agent who runs the lab gave us a detailed talk about the different techniques that the lab uses in order to provide evidence for various legal cases, such as homicide cases. He also answered many of our questions about the digital forensic analytics landscape both in past and present. After lunch from a nearby mall (where I got some pizza), we had more visits, to both Crowdstrike and Cisco. Crowdstrike gave us a tour and various presentations about who they are, and what they do. Cisco had a presentation about Cisco, as well as a long questions and answers session, causing us to miss out on their demonstration due to time restraints. After this, we spent the evening at Huntington beach nearby, to sunbathe, play in the sea, and watch the sun set over the pier. Once the sun had set, we regrouped, and walked to a nearby taco restaurant for dinner. I opted to have a burrito instead, which proved to be a good decision given the stark contrast in portion size between the tacos and the burritos. Three or four of us stopped in at a Dairy Queen on the walk back to the minibuses to get dessert! However, it was now late, so once we were back at the accomodation, a lot of us went straight to sleep.

          <b>Day Nineteen - Thursday</b>
          <br>
          After another early start for breakfast, today we would not be leaving the high school campus just yet. We had an activity at the school's cyber-focused lab, where we were given a troubleshooting "lab" by some programme alumni students, and some students currently enrolled at the school. The difficulty for this was slightly underestimated, as many of the teams finished quickly. This was because the Windows virtual machine merely needed DHCP enabling, and a firewall rule deleted, and the Ubuntu virtual machine needed a line changed in <code>apt</code>'s sources list, an exclusion removed from <code>locate</code>'s database populator and <code>/etc/passwd</code> needed editing so that the user's shell was <code>/bin/bash</code> rather than <code>/bin/sh</code>. The team went away that evening knowing that for the main competition, the difficulty would need to be stepped up. In the meantime, there was a much harder Windows Server virtual machine, which had a startup task to shutdown the VM, as well as everything except powershell being disabled by group policy (including group policy itself). This was solveable by editing the registry keys used by group policy through powershell. The afternoon held a trip to Disney Studios, to learn about how Disney keeps their site, databases and platforms secure and functional. This also included a tour around their offices. After this, we were given some cultural time, which included attempting to visit the Hollywood sign (however, the roads to it were closed), as well as Beverly Hills, and the Universal Citywalk, where there was an opportunity to grab food, as well as go shopping in the rather expensive tourism-focused shops. We were then brought back to the high school for the night.
          <br><br>

          <b>Day Twenty - Friday</b>
          <br>
          After breakfast today, we were taken back to the lab for the Capture-The-Flag challenges. The team had gone away, and made some new challenges, so that we'd struggle more, and not finish the entire thing within the time we were given. In the same teams that we were in the day before, we were given three hours to complete as many challenges as possible across a wide range of topics including reverse engineering and forensics. Our team ended up placing third! After the results were announced, we were taken to lunch by minibus to a nearby pizza shop, which offered unlimited toppings of your choosing. The pizza I ordered tasted fantastic, but the pizzas were so filling that barely anybody managed to finish theirs, yet alone manage to eat half. Oh well, this left leftover pizza to eat later! The programme's debrief was started after returning by our instructors, Renne and Allen. This also included a informative presentation about CA Polytech, where we were meant to be visiting, but who had to cancel the visit. After the debrief concluded, Allen gave us some useful acronyms to think about when it comes to cyber security, which included the classic PEBKAC, as well as a puzzling PUC acronym. It was then revealed that this actually stood for "Prize Under Chair", and after some confusion, it was found that each and every one of us had a ticket to Disneyland stuck underneath the seats of our chairs! The instructors had done a fantastic job of hiding the trip, especially as we had asked all the way back on the induction day how we could visit Disney studios but not Disneyland. After much excitement, we were taken to dinner at another local Italian restaurant (but nobody was particularly hungry), before each going to bed upon returning to the accomodation.

          <b>Day Twenty-One - Saturday</b>
          <br>
          Today held the visit to Disneyland! After an early start, and cold pizza for breakfast, our instructors drove us down to Disneyland for the day to enjoy the final full day of our trip to the United States. This gave us the opportunity to experience some fantastic rides such as Hyperspace Mountain, Thunder Mountain, and Splash Mountain (noticing a theme?). After a tiring, but exhilarating day, we returned to the accomodation for the final time, to pack, rest, and relax before our flight the next day.
          <br><br>

          <b>Day Twenty-Two - Sunday</b>
          <br>
          Today is the day where we would all be going our seperate ways to return home. A few of the American participants had early flights home, and so were taken to the airport by minibus shortly after 5am. The remaining Americans were more local, and were picked up by family during the course of the morning, while some people packed (if they hadn't already). Breakfast and lunch today were at the accomodation again. Not much happened today, except a lot of collective sadness as the three weeks we had just spent together were coming to a close. Our flight departed at 5:45pm, and would land near midday in Britain, for us to find our parents and be taken home.
